In this task, we use Logistic Regression, a machine learning classification algorithm, to predict whether stock prices will move up or down daily.
We calculate daily returns and create features like rolling averages and standard deviations, which capture trends in historical stock data.
The data is then normalized for the model to learn effectively. 
After splitting and scaling the dataset, we train and evaluate the Logistic Regression model, which provides insights into its predictive performance on unseen data. 
Finally, we display the modelâ€™s accuracy on both training and testing datasets.
